## Subheadline

This website is based on [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/). It's primary purpose is to serve as portfolio, online business card and blog.

Blog content can be written in and provided by a variety of ways. It can be stored in and read from a content management system or be written to files. To keep things simple, i have decided to use a file-based approach that is built on top of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

A lot of my written content will be about technical topics and code, which is why i have decided to embed some code into this article to test the syntax highlighting features of my site.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import { css } from 'linaria'
import React from 'react'
import LogoSvg from './site-logo.svg'

const logo = css`
  width: 140px;
  height: 45px;
`

const SiteLogo = () => {
  return (
    <Link to="/">
      <LogoSvg role="img" className={logo} />
    </Link>
  )
}

export default SiteLogo
```

Also, there's more text here to see what it's like if there's more content below a paragraph of syntax highlighted code.
